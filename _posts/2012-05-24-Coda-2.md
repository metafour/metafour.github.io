Since Coda 2 is on sale I would like to try it out in order to determine if it is a good fit for my personal site workflow. I need to start out by testing *git* functionality.
Seems git support is not working as well as I had hoped and there is no documentation available on it in the help files or on panic.com.

UPDATE: I purchased Coda 2 the first day it was launched. It has now become my goto app for updating the website. I figured out he git configuration and since updates are handled via post commit hooks I can easily type up or edit a post and have Coda 2 commit and update the site with a couple of clicks. If I don't feel like using the command line interface to update the site I no longer have to. Definitely worth the purchase.
